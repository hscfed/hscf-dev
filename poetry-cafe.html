        <p>
          We hope you will join us for an evening of creativity, inspiration,
          beautiful words... poetry!
        </p>
        <p>
          Below, you will find information on how to prepare for a poetry
          presentation and how to do your very best.
        </p>

        <p>
          Come and share a passage of literature that has moved you, thrilled
          you, captured your imagination, or transported you to another world...
        </p>

        <p>HSCF Members, come take the stage at the Poetry Cafe!!</p>

        <h2>First Things First:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Choose a poem that you enjoy!</li>
          <li>
            Memorize the poem - know it really well so you are comfortable
            saying it in front of other people.
          </li>
          <li>
            Practice in front of a mirror so you see what your audience will see
            - practice good eye contact!
          </li>
          <li>
            Please keep recitations close to 2 minutes. If you have chosen a
            very long poem, choose your favourite section of the poem that will
            fit within the time limit.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practice! Practice! Practice!</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Start with the title of the poem and the poet's name, for example:
            "<em>Daffodils</em> by William Wordsworth".
          </li>
          <li>Look at everyone.</li>
          <li>Speak loudly and clearly so everyone can hear.</li>
          <li>
            At the end of your poem, pause to let the words settle over the
            audience, then walk away.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the words of the poem do the emotional work - be the narrator;
            tell us the story.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>One Final Thing:</h2>
        <p>
          You are welcome to bring along a prompter
          <em
            >(a person seated in the front of the audience who supplies a
            forgotten word or line to the performer during their
            recitations)</em
          >
          in case you need a little help. We will have a designated seat for
          just that individual. Be sure to provide them with a copy of your
          poem.
        </p>
