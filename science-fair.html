        <h1>Science & Heritage Fair</h1>
        <p>
          HSCF hosts a Science & Heritage Fair every year! Students may choose
          to do a Science Fair Project or a Heritage Fair Project.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>SCIENCE FAIR PROJECTS</strong> are fabulous presentations that
          showcase a <em>science</em> topic of the student's choice. Science
          projects are presented in one of two ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Experiment Format:</strong>
            <em>(eg. Which Leftovers in my Fridge Grow Blue Mold?)</em> The
            experiment format should use the scientific method including a clear
            purpose, hypothesis, procedure, materials list, data or
            observations, results, analysis and conclusions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Model Format:</strong>
            <em>(eg. the Lifecycle of a Frog / Simple Machines / Rocks)</em> The
            model format may also be known as a "study"; it does not require the
            scientific method.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>HERITAGE FAIR PROJECTS</strong> are fabulous presentations
          that showcase a <em>Canadian social studies</em> topic. They should
          have a Canadian heritage theme <em>(historical or geographical)</em>.
          The topic could be specific to one period of time, or show development
          over time. These projects should also demonstrate an understanding of
          research skills <em>(e.g. using primary & secondary sources)</em>.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <p>
          Students may work individually or with others on the same project. The
          display dimensions should be no more than 2m wide x 1m deep. The
          display must be titled and credit must be given to resources used.
          <em
            >(Often younger students will bring along the books they used or
            write a list of titles, while older students may use this
            opportunity to include a more detailed bibliography).</em
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Students will receive verbal and written feedback on their displays
          from our wonderful team of judges. To make this event superb, each
          family is asked to provide at least one judge. This could be you,
          another parent, grandparent, friend, aunt, uncle, pastor, etc. that
          has a genuine interest in listening to the children.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each child will have one judge come to talk to them, as well as have
          time to talk with other parents and kids about their project. Judges
          will be looking for ways the students have integrated Biblical truths
          or references into their project.
