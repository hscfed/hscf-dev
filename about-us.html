    <p>
      Member families come from a wide variety of church affiliations, but are united in our statement of faith and
      goals & philosophy that are based on Biblical principles.
    </p>


    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>
      HSCF seeks to facilitate building a Christian community for homeshooling families by providing opportunities for
      their involvement in meetings and activities and supporting parents in their responsibility of directing their
      children's education.
    </p>

    <h2>Statement of Faith</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>I believe the Bible is the inspired word of God and is my supreme and final authority.</li>
      <li>I believe there is one God eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</li>
      <li>I believe our Lord Jesus is the Son of God, conceived of the Holy Spirit to Mary, a virgin. He died on a
        cross. The shedding of His blood was the atonement for my sins. I believe He was raised from the dead and
        ascended to heaven - where He is my advocate at the Father's right hand.</li>
      <li>I believe in the personal and literal return of Jesus Christ for His Church.</li>
      <li>I believe Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven and that a person must receive Him as their Saviour and
        Lord.</li>
      <li>I believe in life after death - either in heaven or in hell.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Goals & Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The goal of the Association is to serve as the unifying body for Christian Homeschools and share its personnel
        and resources to the best possible advantage of all.</li>
      <li>The objective of the Association shall be to encourage and edify this God-ordained system of education that is
        distinctly Christian.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p>We believe that:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>God is the source of all truth and this must be the unifying principle in education.</li>
      <li>Christian parents should have the option of quality home-centered education for their children which is
        distinctly Christian.</li>
      <li>The ultimate aim of Christian home education is to develop the abilities of the individual in order that he or
        she might fulfill God's will and make a positive contribution to the Church and society.</li>
    </ol>
