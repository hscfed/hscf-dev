            >Please complete the three steps below to become a new HSCF member
            or to renew your membership.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          The HSCF membership year is from July 1 to June 30. Registration for
          the new HSCF season will open on July 1 of that season and the first
          meeting is scheduled for the last Monday of August.
        </p>
        <p>
          The annual membership fee is not prorated for any months missed, so we
          do not generally accept new memberships late in the membership year.
        </p>

                <li>
                  I believe the Bible is the inspired word of God and is my
                  supreme and final authority.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I believe there is one God eternally existing in three
                  persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I believe our Lord Jesus is the Son of God, conceived of the
                  Holy Spirit to Mary, a virgin. He died on a cross. The
                  shedding of His blood was the atonement for my sins. I believe
                  He was raised from the dead and ascended to heaven - where He
                  is my advocate at the Father's right hand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I believe in the personal and literal return of Jesus Christ
                  for His Church.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I believe Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven and that a
                  person must receive Him as their Saviour and Lord.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I believe in life after death - either in heaven or in hell.
