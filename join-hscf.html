            <li>I believe the Bible is the inspired word of God and is my supreme and final authority.</li>
            <li>I believe there is one God eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</li>
            <li>I believe our Lord Jesus is the Son of God, conceived of the Holy Spirit to Mary, a virgin. He died on a
              cross. The shedding of His blood was the atonement for my sins. I believe He was raised from the dead and
              ascended to heaven - where He is my advocate at the Father's right hand.</li>
            <li>I believe in the personal and literal return of Jesus Christ for His Church.</li>
            <li>I believe Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven and that a person must receive Him as their Saviour and
              Lord.</li>
            <li>I believe in life after death - either in heaven or in hell.</li>
