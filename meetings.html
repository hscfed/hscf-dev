        <h1>Meetings</h1>
        <p>
          HSCF runs a number of meetings where there are no formal events
          occurring. This is an opportunity to host homeschool speakers, run
          one-time events, utilize the HSCF Library or simply meet with fellow
          homeschoolers for a time of sharing and encouragement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the speakers we've hosted in the past include Therese
          MacDonald, Dr. Helder, AHEA representatives and various homeschooling
          through high school, homeschooling with toddlers or homeschooling
          special needs experts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those wanting to experience HSCF to see if it is the right fit for
          their family are welcome to attend one meeting free of charge... no
          membership required.
